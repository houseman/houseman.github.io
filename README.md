I joined Takealot in September 2020, as a **Senior Software Engineer** (SSEI) in the Discovery Backend (DSCBE) team.
This team's domain is product discovery within the Shopfront business unit. This covers a wide range of integrations:
- Content (to a headless CMS)
- Search (given the end user's search criteria, retrieve an return search results to frontend)
- Catalogue (for returned search results, or a context identifier such as SKU, retrieve catalogue data and return to frontend)
- Recommendations (given the user's context, retrieve product recommendations and return to frontend)
- Advertising (given the user's context, retrieve sponsored product recommendations or banner ads and return to frontend)

In addition to these shopfront components, additional marketing tech also falls within this teams purview:
- Product data feeds to third-party aggregators (such as Google Marketplace, amongst others)
- Newsletter integrations (event-based synchronisation of data to third-party communications provider)

Takealot is a great environment to be a part of; Everything is done at enormous scale, and runs on microservices in containerized Kubernetes clusters.
The infrastructure at Takealot runs almost exclusively in Kubernetes, and engineers are expected to be proficient in managing and deploying to Kubernetes clusters (using Helm)
The standard of engineering is very high, and I have been privileged to work alongside some of the smartest people in our industry. Takealot is a Python shop, and our team's work is almost exclusively implemented through Python. We follow a set of Python engineering best practices such as:
- Mypy static type-checker
- Black code formatter
- Flake8 code style-enforcer
- Full unit test coverage, as well as automated integration testing

We follow an Agile methodology; daily stand-up meetings, two-week sprints, backlog grooming, sprint planning etc. Deployment is continuous, and achieved through a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

As a senior member of the DSCBE team, I have the following responsibilities and roles:
- Mentor junior and intermediate team-members, mostly through code review
- Seek technological advancement of our team's domain through continuous improvement
- Design technical specifications that meet business requirements (at scale)
- Project Lead; plan work into sprints, liaising with stakeholders (product managers, vendors, other teams) in order to ensure on-time project delivery
- Interview engineering candidates, assess their abilities and suitability, and make appointment recommendations to management

StockFair was my own startup business, which I ran for just under five years, from October 2015 until September 2020.

The business mission was to be the first and best online auction platform, for the sale of livestock in South Africa.
I developed the platform myself, using these technologies:
- Symfony Framework (PHP 5)
- MySql
- Bootstrap framework for HTML, CSS and Javascript

The product was, I believe, a pretty good one. I learned the following from this experience:
- ideas are just ideas; execution is everything
- changing an industry is difficult; it takes a lot of time, and money!
- being first is not necessarily a good thing; timing is important
- being a one-person-show is a lonely pursuit; I enjoy having colleagues and no one person is the best at everything
- a bad hire is worse than a vacant position; the wrong person for teh job can and will do more harm than good
- working for yourself does not really make your time flexible; if you are customer-focused you are always "on call"

For a number of reasons, the business was ultimately a failure, and was shut down end August 2020.

### Internet Solutions

I was a **Senior Systems Engineer** at Internet Solutions (IS).
IS was the enterprise internet service provider of choice for many years, and was a division of Dimension Data.

Here I was lead developer on various internal PHP & Perl projects within the Broadband and VoIP Billing and Provisioning departments.
Various projects undertaken include:
- Integration of VoIP billing data for invoice generation into SAP via a JMS queue
- Voice Carrier Least Cost Routing; a LCR calculation application, which determines the lowest cost international call routes, and implements these preferred routes via routing policies delivered to the network edge
- NumberDB v2 developed using Symfony 2; used by engineers and support staff to allocate and manage VoIP numbers from within allocated number blocks assigned by ICASA. NumberDB also has a SOAP API that enabled integration with provisioning and support systems
- Automated ADSL router provisioning and configuration; a REST service that received requests from ADSL router firmware on initial start-up, and generates a customised routing and firewall configuration for the relevant client, which was then downloaded and installed to the router flash storage

After more than a decade of working for IS, I decided to attempt my onw startup business. Fortunately, I was able to continue working with IS for a further 30 months, on a part-time contract basis.

![Windows NT](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows%20NT-003399?style=flat&logo=windowsxp&logoColor=white)

As **Head of IT** at Junk Mail Publishing (at the time the largest online classified advertising publisher in South Africa), I ran various development projects, and was also responsible for the general management of the IT department (IT help desk and Web Support).

One of the more memorable projects that I successfully implemented at Junk Mail, was South Africa's first classified ads SMS line.
Advertisers could send their classified ad content via SMS to a mobile number that terminated to a Nokia GSM modem, connected to a Linux server by means of a RS232 serial cable. I wrote a Perl script that would poll the comm port and retrieve SMS data, sanitise and validate this data, and send it to a HTTP REST API which would insert this content into a queue for production.

These were innovative times, and another useful tool that we produced, was a PHP framework that could inspect a database structure, and create data classes and other scaffolding based on this. This was (to the best of my knowledge) in a time before any similar PHP frameworks existed, and this saved our team much time and repetitive work, enabling a more agile approach to our software development projects.

My duties at Junk Mail included:
- Day-to-day operational management
- Managing project deliverables, and expectations
- Business Requirements Analysis, and solutions Design
- Presenting progress reports to the Executive Committee

This position gave me exposure to management at a relatively young age (24 years old). I learned a lot; and was fortunate enough to receive some really excellent management training. I ultimately decided however, that I should pursue an Individual Contributor route in my career.
